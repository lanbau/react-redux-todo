Reducer is like a listener? Listening to Actions Dispatched By Containers...
When it matches, reduce the state into something and return it.

Example...
Add a addto item

1. User keys in text in input form and clicks on submit button
2. submit sends text to onsubmit callback function in Container (containers/AddTodo.js)
3. Smart Component (containers/AddTodo.js) dispatches an action with the input
4. action receives text and returns an object with type addtodo...
5. reducer listens to addtodo event? then takes addtodo object and state... and returns a modified state array

6. Now, todolist needs to be changed.. how ah?
